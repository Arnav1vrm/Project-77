        <p>Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for
             Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.</p>
             <p>It will keep a console opened after the program will be finished.
                  This way, the console will display "Hello World" and a blinking cursor underneath. The Console.
                   ReadLine(); is the key here, the program waits for the users input before closing the console window.</p>
